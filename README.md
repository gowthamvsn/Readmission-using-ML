# Hospital Readmission Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted to the hospital
after discharge using machine learning models.

## Problem Statement
Hospital readmissions are costly and often preventable.  
The goal of this project is to identify patients at high risk of readmission
so hospitals can improve discharge planning and follow-up care.

## Dataset
- Diabetes Readmission Dataset (UCI / Kaggle)
